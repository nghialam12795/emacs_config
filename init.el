;; General Setting
;; --------------------------------------------------------

;; A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up the gc
;; threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, then reset it later by
;; enabling `gcmh-mode'. Not resetting it will cause stuttering/freezes.
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum
      gc-cons-percentage 0.6)

;; In noninteractive sessions, prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
;; prevent the use of stale byte-code. Otherwise, it saves us a little IO time
;; to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.
(setq load-prefer-newer noninteractive)

;; Load config file
(if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory))
    (load-file (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory))
